### üõ†Ô∏è Making a Checklist Mod

1. Inside `GameData`, create a folder named after your mod.
2. Create a folder in the folder you just created, it has to be called `Checklists`.
3. Add a `.txt` file for example with one checklist item per line, like:
   ```
   False|SAS
   False|RCS
   False|Solar Panels
   ```
   False would be that it is **not** checked and true would be that it **will** be checked.
4. To make the mod show up please make a `.txt` file inside your folder and call it `KerbalChecklistsConfig.txt`.
   You should put this into the `.txt` file and save it.
   ```
   ModName=ExampleMod
   Author=averageksp
   AddToKerbalChecklists=true
   ```
5. **REQUIRED**: If you want to publish your mod (e.g. to CKAN, Spacedock, etc.) a licence **MUST** be included.
