## How to Compile
How to compile it yourself.

1. Open Visual Studio 2022
2. Copy the source code from this repository
3. Select the references below
   ```
   KSPAssets.dll
   UnityEngine.InputModule.dll
   UnityEngine.InputLegacyModule.dll
   UnityEngine.PhysicsModule.dll
   KSPAssets.XmlSerializers.dll
   UnityEngine.AnimationModulue.dll
   UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
   UnityEngine.IMGUIModule.dll
   UnityEngine.UI.dll
   Assembly-CSharp.dll
   Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll
   ```
4. After that compile it yourself and make a folder called KerbalChecklists in your GameData folder
5. And you're done! There will be no icon for it so you have to copy it from the actual release and create your own folder called Textures in the KerbalChecklists so it should look like this
   ```
   KerbalChecklists/Textures/icon.png
   ```
